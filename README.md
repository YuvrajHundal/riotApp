# riotApp
This project was built using Riot Games API
It works by someone with a League of Legends account to enter their account information. Just their summoner name and the region they play are required.
If proper information is entered then the program will return a their match history for ranked games. The user can click on a recent game to
gain view some more stats regarding their recent match. Information such as longest life and damage taken can be viewed.
The main technology used for this project was the PHP language, however in order for the whole project to come together
HMTL/CSS javascript and bootstrap were used.
